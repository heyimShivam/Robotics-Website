          Robotics Society is a platform where students from various branches
          work together to nurture their technical understanding and culture
          their innovative ideas and dreams about robotics into reality.We would
          like to take all steps to excite and accelerate the interest of
          robotics among the students. We facilitate indispensable guidance
          through workshops and tutorials. It helps students to take up
          challenges from day to day life scenarios, orient the challenges to
          feasible solution form, stimulate the thought process of students and
          let them convert their ideas to prototypes by their technical skills,
          and creativity.
